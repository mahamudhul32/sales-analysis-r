# Superstore Sales Data Analysis (R Project)
This is my first Data Science portfolio project. In this project, I have analyzed a Superstore's sales data using R and the ggplot2 library.

## Project Objectives
Through this analysis, I aimed to answer 5 key business questions:
1. Sales Trend: How do sales evolve over time?
2. Profit by Category: Which product categories are most profitable?
3. Shipping Mode: Which shipping methods are preferred by customers?
4. Discount vs. Profit: Does offering higher discounts lead to more profit? (Correlation analysis).
5. Regional Performance: Which region is performing best in terms of sales?

## Tools & Libraries
1. Language: R Programming
2. Libraries: ggplot2, dplyr, lubridate, plotly

## Key Insights
1. Discount vs. Profit: I discovered a negative correlation where discounts exceeding 20% lead to a rapid decline in profit margins.
2. Top Category: The Technology category generates the highest profit compared to Furniture and Office Supplies.
3. Top Region: The West region is the best-performing area in terms of total sales volume.

## How to Run the Code
1. Ensure you have R and R Studio installed on your system.
2. Download the sales_analysis.R file from this repository.
3. Open the file in R Studio and install the required packages by running: install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "lubridate", "plotly"))
4. Run the script to see the visualizations and analysis.
